1.    a)   Answer the following   points   regarding the   Linear   Probability   Model:
(i)                Using standard   mathematical   notation, outline the   Linear   Probability   Model for   binary dependent variables.       [20   marks]
(ii)             Explain   how the   LPM   can   be   used   to   predict   binary   choices.       [5   marks]
(iii)          Explain   how   to   interpret   the   regression   coefficients   in   the   LPM.       [10   marks]
(iv)          Explain   what   are   the   main   shortcomings   of   the   LPM?        [15   marks]
b)   Consider a model explaining the monthly sales of a   popular   brand of coffee   as   a function   of its price and the average price of   two competitors.   Also included is an indicator variable   disp=1   if there   is   a   store   display   but   no   newspaper   ad   during the   month   for the target   brand, and 0 otherwise. The indicator variable dispad=1 if there is a store display during   the   month for the target   brand and newspaper ads,   0   otherwise.   The   estimated   results   were obtained   using   Stata:

Sales:   logarithm of   1000’s   boxes sold
Price: average   price of the target   brand   in   $   for a   given   month
Price1 and   Price2: average   prices of two competitors.
(i)       Write down the regression model and   interpret the   meaning   and   significance   of   each coefficient, including the       intercept. Are the signs   and   the relative   magnitudes for the advertising variables consistent with economic   logic?           [25   marks]
(ii)    Label the   parameters   in   the   equation   β1,   β2      … β6   .   With   β5       and β6       corresponding   to the coefficients of disp   and   dispad,   respectively.   If the   null   hypothesis   is   H0   :   β6    ≤   β5   , state the alternative   hypothesis. Why   is   the   test   of this   null   hypothesis   against   the   alternative   hypothesis   interesting?   Carry   out   the   test   at   the   1%   significance, given the calculated t-value   is 6.34. What   do   you   conclude?       [15   marks]
(iii)   What   is   an   indicator   variable   and   how   to   avoid   the   indicator   variable   trap?   In   the   above   regression,   assume   there   is   another   indicator   variable   :   ads=1,   if   there   is   newspaper ads for target   brand, and   ads=0   otherwise.   Explain   how to   obtain an   interaction variable of the   indicator variables disp and   ads.       [10   marks]Total [100 marks] 
2.   a)   Compare and contrast the Durbin-Watson (DW) d-statistic test with   the   Lagrange   Multiplier   (LM) approach to test for serial correlation   in time   series   models.        [50   marks]
b)   We   try   to   explore   the   relationship   between   the   cost   per   student   and   related   factors   at   four-year    colleges    in    the    U.S.,    covering    the    period    1987    to      2011.   We      run   a      OLS   regression   using Stata, and the   results are   as   below:

(i)                Write down the   regression   model.       [10   marks]
(ii)             If we   consider   university ‘identity’   as   a   factor   that   could   affect   average   cost   per   student,   how   should   we   adjust   the   estimation?   Write   down   the   new   model   and   explain the differences with the   model   in   point   (i).        [25   marks]

c)    We   estimate   a   regression   describing the   relationship   between the   cost   per   student   and   related factors at four-year colleges in the U.S., covering the period 1987 to 2011,   where   lntc   is the   logarithm total   cost   per   student, ftestu   is   the   number   of full   time   equivalent   students, ftgrad is the number of full-time graduate students, tt   is the   number of tenure   track faculty per 100 students, GA is the number of   graduate assistants per 100 students,   and CF   is the   number of contract faculty   per   100 students,   which   are   hired   on   a   year   to   year   basis.
